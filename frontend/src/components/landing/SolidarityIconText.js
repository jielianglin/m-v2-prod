            Acknowledging and celebrating different backgrounds, migration stories, and experiences,
            our search is to create a deeper understanding of one another, and to explore the presence
            of solidarity and the absence of judgment. Connection and empathy towards one another will be
            strengthened.

            Users can respond to their pictures by mapping their emotions and sensations on to them, like painting.
